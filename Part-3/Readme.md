# Assignment 3.3
For Assignment-3: Part-3, follow these steps:

- **Initiate Pull Request:** Squash your commits, add the contributors (you can your team members) and submit the work through a Pull Request.

- **Document Evolution:** Refine the document you have in Part-2. There are two types of feedback to anticipate: one from the project maintainers and the other from TAG-Security. Feedback from project maintainers will aim to accurately represent the project's security posture, while TAG-Security will focus on enhancing the document's coverage and quality. Since some of the project haven't completely provided their feedback, expect ongoing feedback from both these sources.

- **Fix feedback:** The main goal of Part-3 is to finalize the document by addressing all feedback received from both project maintainers and TAG-Security. Your Team has to implement any changes necessary to address the feedback.

- **Action Items:** Based on the insights from your team's Security Self-Assessment, determine and initiate necessary action items. This may include addressing security vulnerabilities or implementing suggested improvements in the project or development pipeline. Consider creating a GitHub Issue with the project maintainers to specifically address these issues you brought up.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't open multiple PRs. Open only one PR per Project and follow the format mentioned in FAQs.

> [!NOTE]
> These steps are crucial for creating a finishing your Assignment 3, security self-assessment document.
> Adding your team members as co-authors during your commit squash will be curcial to provide them credit for the PR. You can't do it later.
> Perform these steps carefully as you can't revert the changes.

Evaluation will be based on your team's proficiency in incorporating feedback and finalizing the document.
Your project maintainer's feedback will also be considered, we will send out feedback forms to project maintainers soon.
