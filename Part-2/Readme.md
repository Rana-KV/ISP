# Assginment 3.2
For Assignment-3: Part-2, follow these steps:

- **Initiate Discussions:** Start conversations with the project maintainers after completing Assignment Part-1. Use Slack or other communication platforms employed by the project. It's advisable to post a message in the Project's CNCF Slack channel to start discussions about your Security Self-Assessment.


- **Document Evolution:** Refine and expand the initial document. Focus on incorporating new insights and addressing any missing information.

- **Finalize the Document:** The primary aim of Part-2 is to complete and finalize the document. This should be done in collaboration with project maintainers for accuracy and comprehensiveness.

- **Action Items:** Based on the insights from your team's Security Self-Assessment, determine and initiate necessary action items. This may include addressing security vulnerabilities or implementing suggested improvements in the project or development pipeline. Consider creating a GitHub Issue with the project maintainers to specifically address these issues you brought up.


These steps are crucial for creating a thorough and effective security self-assessment document.

Your team will be evaluated in two categories, based the participation in discussions on Slack and initiative to solve the issues you found.
