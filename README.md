## Stages
### Stage-1: **Preparation**
This marks the initial stage where Security Pals initiate a GitHub issue to monitor their work progress and concurrently establish a placeholder for the security self-assessment document. <br><br>
Difficulty: ⭐️☆☆☆☆ <br>
Time: ⭐️☆☆☆☆ <br>

- Create a GitHub issue:
  - Create a Github issue in CNCF TAG-Security Github repository to initiate the process.
  - Update the information in the Github issue.<br>

- Review the Project Information:
  - Review available project information and documentation.
  - This includes prior KubeCon talks, webpages, project documentation, etc.<br>
  **Note:** This initial review does not require interaction with project maintainers.

- Create draft security self-assessment document:
  - Fork the CNCF TAG-Security repository.
  - Create a new folder for your project in the assessments/projects folder.  
  - Create a draft document for the security self assessment in your project folder.
  - This document includes metadata details and placeholders for all sections.
  - Update the Metadata section of the document.<br>
  
### Stage-2: **Understanding the Project**
This is the most important part for all Security Pals to internalize and understand for a project.
If the project is interested in examining this portion of the self assessment, then it would also be
helpful for the Security Pals to make the project aware of it at this point. However, the Security
Pals need not wait for a response, and can safely continue to the next stage.<br><br>
Difficulty: ⭐️⭐️☆☆☆ <br>
Time: ⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆ <br>
- Security Pals must understand the overall project at a sufficient level of detail.
  - In essence, before doing more detailed security work, one should understand:
    - Project functionality and typical usage.
    - Roles of involved parties (e.g., sidecar, central server, maintainers).
    - Actions performed (e.g., data collection, query language, software release).
    - Project's goals (e.g., access control, software source control).
    - Project's non-goals (e.g., preventing insider data leaks).
- Complete the following sections in the Overview section of the self assessment document:
  - About Project
  - Background
  - Actors
  - Actions
  - Goals
  - Non-Goals 
<br>

**Note:** It is recommended you do this step independently and then compare notes with your teammates.
